# Text summarization with interactive question answering
The objective of our project is to design a website that is similar to IEEE. the users can react with the website and ask about the article so we summarize the article for the user and make recommendations for the user with the same topic of the article.   

## Usage
text summarization model , the user can request an article in any topic and they will be provided a summary of an article of the topic that they requested and will also be provided a recommendation of other articles of the same topic. -Moreover, the user can ask any question related to the topic that he requested and the website will provide an answer which is extracted from the summary .also there is an option to extract the answer from Wikipedia instead of the summary if the user ask. The website provide interaction with the user by asking questions . as the website can provide answers which is extracted from the summary or from Wikipedia if the user ask.Classification and clustering models were used as part of the recommendation system. thentext summarization then question answering
